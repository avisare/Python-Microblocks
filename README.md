# Explanation
In the transportation protocols library we can use tcp or udp
protocols, with the same functions name: "receive" and "send"

# Usage
In order to receive just call receive function on the tcp/udp connection
object, and as well in order to send.
There is comprehensive example in the run_transportation_protocol.py file.
