# Python-Microblocks
In the folder you can see 3 installers. 
## Shared Memory Client
This is the main installer, which everything you need is in there.
You need to run the installer and then open the readme html page and follow
the instructions there.

## Shared Memory Server
In this installer you can find the files that supposed to be oon the server.
This installer is already found in the previous installer.
If you want to manually check the server put and open the installer in
C:/servers directory on the remote machine

## Shared Memory Wrapper
In this installer there are 2 necessary  files that need to exist in order
to use the Shared Memory Wrapper module in python 3.8.
These files are also can be found in the first installer, but in case you only
need the regular module without any extensions you can use and open this installer.

If you have any difficulties, feel free to ask [Noam Mizrahi](mailto:noammizrahi2003@gmail.com) about.
